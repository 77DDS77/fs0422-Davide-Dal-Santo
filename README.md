In this repository you can find all my work since the start of my code-learning journey
with the EPICODE family.

Each Module lasted a month and contains a directory for each week, which also contains a directory for each day.

### How is it organized?

- BE: all the Back-end module is inside there.
- M1, M2, M3 : this are the Front-end modules.
- Each day contains the notes I took during the lesson and the excercise on that topic.
- All weeks folders have a d5 directory that contains the exam project for that week.
- Week 4 of every module was a Build Week (a shared project that me and my group had to develop together)

NB: if a module doesn't have its BW (BuildWeek) directory it's because it 
has been developed on a collegue Repository, I will link them below.
