# BACK-END MODULE

This module contains all my works from the Back-end course.

The projects I'm most proud of are:
 - [First Full-stack project](https://github.com/77DDS77/fs0422-Davide-Dal-Santo/tree/master/BE/M2/BW2) developed during the last BuildWeek together with [Dario Piovani](https://github.com/PiovaD) (REST API with JWT authentication)
 - [First microservices development](https://github.com/77DDS77/fs0422-Davide-Dal-Santo/tree/master/BE/M2/W3/D2/HW)  (friendly named Netflix)
